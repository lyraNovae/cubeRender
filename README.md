# cubeRender
Trying to build a basic java program that renders a cube in 3d and, hopefully, allows me to manipulate or animate it.
In order for this code to function, it uses the DrawingPanel program (v 4.07) by Stuart Reges and Marty Stepp. This
program provides a convenient object for initializing a canvas to draw figures on.
This code was written starting 2022-4-11 by an ameteur programmer in a beginning programming class. Do not expect it
to be clean or efficient.
Programming environment - jGRASP
